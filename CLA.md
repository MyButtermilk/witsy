## Contributor License Agreement

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Witsy (the "Project"). To clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions from any person or entity, Kochava Inc. (the "Project Maintainer") must have a Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") on file that has been signed by each contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms below. This agreement is for your protection as a contributor as well as the protection of the Project and its users; it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.

By signing this Contributor License Agreement, you accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for your present and future Contributions submitted to the Project.

1. Definitions
“You” (or "Your") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with the Project Maintainer.
"Contribution" shall mean any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to the Project Maintainer for inclusion in, or documentation of, the Project.
"Project" shall mean the software, documentation, or other materials maintained by the Project Maintainer and licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License version 3 ("AGPLv3").

2. Grant of Copyright License
You hereby grant to the Project Maintainer and to recipients of software distributed by the Project Maintainer a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works under the terms of the AGPLv3, as published by the Free Software Foundation.

3. Grant of Patent License
You hereby grant to the Project Maintainer and to recipients of software distributed by the Project Maintainer a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Project, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Project to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that Your Contribution, or the Project to which You have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or Project shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Source Code Availability
You agree that Your Contributions to the Project are subject to the terms of the AGPLv3, including the requirement to make available the source code of any modified versions of the Project that You use or distribute, particularly when the Project is used to provide a service over a network.

5. Representations
You represent that You are legally entitled to grant the above licenses. If Your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that You create that includes Your Contributions, You represent that You have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that Your employer has waived such rights for Your Contributions to the Project Maintainer, or that Your employer has executed a separate Contributor License Agreement with the Project Maintainer.
<br/>
<br/>
You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation. You represent that Your Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which You are personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your Contributions.

6. No Additional Obligations
You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

7. Submission of Contributions
Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Project by You to the Project Maintainer shall be under the terms and conditions of this Agreement, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement You may have executed with the Project Maintainer regarding such Contributions.

8. Miscellaneous
This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. You agree to notify the Project Maintainer of any facts or circumstances of which You become aware that would make these representations inaccurate in any respect.
