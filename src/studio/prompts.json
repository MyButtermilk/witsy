The character has exaggerated features (such as a large nose or chin) and a minimal color palette. The outfit reflects the character's typical style or personality and is rendered in flat colors with no shading or texture effects. Hands are behind the back, and the posture is upright and slightly leaning back for a pompous or dignified expression. Background is a solid muted green. No smudging. No shading. Vector friendly. No paper textures or grain effects. Bold and crisp vector lines. Keep the illustration vector-friendly and clean. Square aspect ratio."
